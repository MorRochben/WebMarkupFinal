                        Hoofddorp is a city in the Netherlands. It used to be an old village but in the last 2 decades
                        a lot of new buildings have been built here transforming it into a city. Hoofddorp has a giant
                        city centre with lots of clothing stores and everything else you can
                        desire. From freshly baked chicken to the newest piece of technology, you can find it here.

                        Hoofddorp is divided in 7 big neighborhoods: City centre, Bornholm, Floriande, Graan voor Visch,
                        Overbos, Pax and Toolenburg. Hoofddorp Counts a total of 75.5 thousand inhabitants and is
                        expected to grow to over 90 thousand in 2020. because despite most of Hoofddorp having been
                        built in the last 2 decades, they're far from being done expanding.

                        There is also a big industrial area in the eastern side Hoofddorp. This is quite popular with
                        companies because of its proximity to the nearby train station, which is a 4 minute train ride
                        away from the Netherlands biggest airport Schiphol.

                        Floriande is the biggest neighborhood within Hoofddorp with over 17 thousand people, despite being only added relatively recently. Floriande contains mostly homes but that doesn’t mean there isn’t anything to do, quite the opposite.

                        The most recent addition has been the giant sport centre King Willem-Alexander, which is obviously named after the dutch king. The sports centre was built to celebrate the coronation of King Willem-Alexander and contains several halls where people can do sports like basketball, indoor football, badminton, gymnastics or judo but also has 2 swimming pools where people can do water polo, competitive swimming, underwater hockey synchronised swimming or just go for a leisurely swim.

                        There is also a baseball stadium on the outskirts of Floriande, Which was built with a goal of getting top class Baseball to Floriande. It has 2 full sized baseball fields, 3 medium sized fields and 3 small fields for the kids.

                            There is also a decently sized shopping centre in Floriande, here you can find all your basic necessities. You can buy clothes here. Or order food if you don’t want to cook for yourself, you can choose from pizza, indian, chinese or the snackbar. furthermore there is a bookstore that doubles as a post office, a Kruidvat where you can get all your dermatological needs.

                        There is lots of green in Floriande, a lot of parks, trees and grass.The main road through Floriande even has a row of trees and grass in the middle and on both sides. There is even a forest just outside of Floriande. But in all that green there are also some things to do, There is football fields, playgrounds and even a skatepark. The skatepark has 2 half pipes and plenty of ramps and railings to do all kinds of tricks and is usually populated by older and younger kids alike. So there is always someone to talk to or get advice from. There are even people who go here by car and, due to the lack of parking space for the skatepark, have been forced to park in front of the surrounding houses to the frustration of the people who live there. however a parking lot will not be placed because they want the area to remain green.
